Over the past few days I keep thinking what makes me what I am today &mdash; <sub><sup>a lazy one liner</sup></sub>. Having realized that I started everything early, I was blinded with the thought that I got a heads up. I became the cocky rabbit who got beaten by the turtle. Took me a while, but I'm done racing.

This time I will not run.

I'll write.
