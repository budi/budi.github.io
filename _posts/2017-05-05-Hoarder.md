These past weeks showed me something that I have been denying all my life. I'm a memory hoarder. I use some serious space in my room to keep pictures, letters (well, mostly envelopes, really), postcards, gig pins, bracelets, descend commemorative jacket, 17th birthday gift bag, another jacket, a cassette tape, another bag, shoes...

The list goes on. But it has to stop. Who am I to forbid time to flow and force her to fly?

So from now, I'll try to forget and hopefully succeed.
