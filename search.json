Having realized that I started everything early, I was blinded with the thought that I got a heads up. I became the cocky rabbit who got beaten by the turtle.

He promised &mdash; even though he consciously knows that he will break it soon enough &mdash; to actively contribute to the communities at least on Github.\nEven though lately he doesn’t tweet that much and keep resetting his Instagram account[1], those two channels are still the ones that are the most curent and available for public.\nIf you’re into gaming and avidly play DOTA[2], you won’t be amazed by his records of 45% winning rate. Feel free to add him on Steam, though. He’s a good support.\nIf all else fails, you can just Google “Budi Dharmawan” and see if you can find anything.\n[^] 1. Because fuck integrity.[^] 2. What?
