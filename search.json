Your shiny blag will soon be served over https! Yay!\nFirst thing first: I assume that you are familiar with Hexo and Github, and you know how to push things to a repository. If you’re not &mdash; and willing to learn, &mdash; spend a couple minutes doing Christopher’s “Getting Started with the Hexo Blogging Framework“ and Github’s Hello World Project. You will be AMAZED by the world you’ll unravel just by doing them. :p\nAs the more advanced people already being impatient, let’s get started.This post is heavily inspired by Sheharyar Naseer’s article “Set Up SSL on Github Pages With Custom Domains for Free“ with some adaptation for Hexo. Check out his blog! He writes interesting stuffs.\n1. Getting Your Blog Up on Github PagesSo you wrote your post and it’s served on your port 4000 when you run hexo s. Neat.  Now, create a new repository on Github called &lt;username&gt;.github.io (mine would be budi.github.io) &mdash; yes, that is a repository name.\nYou would also want to install hexo-deployer-git to ease up things. On your project directory, run:\nnpm install hexo-deployer-git --save\nEdit your main _config.yml file to include these lines:\ndeploy:\n  type: git\n  repo: git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io.git\nIf you haven’t setup your SSH public key, you might want to use https on the repo field instead, like so:\ndeploy:\n  type: git\n  repo: https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;username&gt;.github.io.git\nGenerate your blog with hexo g, and you will see files piling up on the public folder of your blog directory. Now run hexo d, wait until it’s all done and viola! Your blog is now up on Github Pages! Open up &lt;username&gt;.github.io on your browser and rejoice.\n2. Setting Up CloudFlareI’m not gonna go into details here, just follow these steps to change your domain name servers to use CloudFlare. If you already setup your domain using CloudFlare before, you can skip ahead to the next step. Upon adding your website, CloudFlare should automatically detect and generate records that match the records on your registrar.\nWhile you’re on CloudFlare, you can add your domain to point to your Github Pages. My strategy is to use my apex domain (budidharmawan.com) and redirect my www subdomain to my apex domain. So on my DNS records, I made sure of these three records:\nTYPE    NAME                VALUE               TTL         DNS &amp; HTTP PROXY\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA       budidharmawan.com   192.30.252.153      Automatic   Both\nA       budidharmawan.com   192.30.252.154      Automatic   Both\nCNAME   www                 budidharmawan.com   Automatic   Both\nThe two IP addresses above is what Github use to serve custom domains. Still on CloudFlare, also check on the Crypto tab on your domain and make sure to set the SSL to Flexible.\nNext step is to setup CNAME so that Github knows you’re using custom domain. On your source directory, add a file called CNAME &mdash; all caps &mdash; with your domain name in it. You can just run this command:\necho your-domain.com &gt;&gt; CNAME\nGenerate and deploy your blog to your Github page once again (on your project directory):\nhexo g &amp;&amp; hexo d\nCheck if the site is live on your custom domain. Open up your browser and go to your custom domain. It should already display your site! Nice~\nIf it doesn’t, here are some checklist to confirm if you missed anything:\n\nCreate a Github repository &lt;username&gt;.github.io\nInstall hexo-deployer-git\nChange the main _config.yml\nGenerate and deploy to the repository\nUpdate A-records and CNAME on CloudFlare to match Github’s IP\nChange SSL setting on Crypto tab to Flexible\nAdd CNAME on source directory\nRe-generate and deploy to the repository\n\n3. Details, details, detailsNow you can actually try to open your site over https and it will show up just fine. But there are some things you need to add/change to make it better.\nOn your main _config.yml file, edit the url setting to use https:\nurl: https://your-domain.com\nAdd canonical link to your site’s &lt;head&gt;:\n&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;&lt;%= config.url %&gt;&quot; /&gt;\nAs mentioned on Sheharyar’s post, also add this script on your head to redirect user from http to https:\n&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n    var host = &quot;yoursite.com&quot;;\n    if ((host == window.location.host) &amp;&amp; (window.location.protocol != &quot;https:&quot;))\n        window.location.protocol = &quot;https&quot;;\n&lt;/script&gt;\nThat’s It!Now your site is served over https! For free! &mdash; well, not really. I mean you pay for the domain..\nLet me know if you have anything to say on the comment section :)"},{"title":"Hello World v.0.0.1","url":"https://budidharmawan.com/2016/05/28/Hello-World-v-0-0-1/","content":"Over the past few days I keep thinking what makes me what I am today &mdash; a lazy one liner.

He promised &mdash; even though he consciously knows that he will break it soon enough &mdash; to actively contribute to the communities at least on Github.\nEven though lately he doesn’t tweet that much and keep resetting his Instagram account[1], those two channels are still the ones that are the most curent and available for public.\nIf you’re into gaming and avidly play DOTA[2], you won’t be amazed by his records of 45% winning rate. Feel free to add him on Steam, though. He’s a good support.\nIf all else fails, you can just Google “Budi Dharmawan” and see if you can find anything.\n1. Because fuck integrity. &cularr;2. What?
