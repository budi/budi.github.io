Before anything else, the first thing you gotta know about him is that he often writes about himself in third person only to make himself feel more down-to-earth. He promised &mdash; even though he <sub><sup>consciously</sup></sub> knows that he will break it soon enough &mdash; to actively contribute to the _communities_ at least on [Github](https://github.com/budi/).

Even though lately he doesn't [tweet](https://twitter.com/budi) that much and keep resetting his [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mmmbut/) account<sup id="fn1-p">[[1]](#fn1-n)</sup>, those two channels are still the ones that are the most curent and available for public.

If you're into gaming and avidly play DOTA<sup id="fn2-p">[[2]](#fn2-n)</sup>, you won't be amazed by his [records](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/115010700) of 45% winning rate. Feel free to add him on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmmbut/), though. He's a good support.

If all else fails, you can just Google "Budi Dharmawan" and see if you can find anything.
