Can't say much, really.

Even though lately he doesn't [tweet](https://twitter.com/budi) that much and keep resetting his [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mmmbut/) account[^1], those two channels are still the ones that are the most curent and available for public.

If you're into gaming and avidly play DOTA[^2], you won't be amazed by his [records](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/115010700) of 45% winning rate. Feel free to add him on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmmbut/), though. He's a good support.

If all else fails, you can just Google "Budi Dharmawan" and see if you can find anything.
